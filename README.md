# resume

A little clojure project to generate my html resume. It is the occasion for me to play with 
[enlive](https://github.com/cgrand/enlive) and [cljss](https://github.com/JeremS/cljss-core).

`lein run` generates the one file version which contains all the generated css inside the generated html.

your option) any later version.
